Programming Assignments as related to coursework in Data Communication Networks.
Programming Assignment 1's goal was to send a file between a client and a host. The host would send an acknowledgement (ACK) once the file was received from the client.
Programming Assignment 2's goal was the same as Programming Assignment 1 only with the addition of an emulator that would randomly drop file packets during transit. The host would have to communicate to the client that a packet was dropped and to resend the packet. The host would also have to be aware of duplicate packets and drop the extra packets as neccessary.
In both programming assignments, the file had to be completely transmitted and outputted to file in the correct order.
Programming Assignment 1 received a grade of 92, Programming Assignment 2 received a grade of 98.
