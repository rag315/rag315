MIT LL Terminal Encounter Model Data Analysis 
- The LLTEM was developed to generate statistically representative encounters between unmanned aircraft and manned aircraft in terminal airspace. The data set consists of 1 Million encounters between two aircraft. This data set can be found at https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets/unmanned-aircraft-terminal-area-encounters  .
